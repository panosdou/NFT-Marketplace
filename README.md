A project in Solidity for a Primary and Secondary NFT market place. 

This project establishes a fundamental ticketing service on the blockchain, utilizing Solidity for the creation of NFT-based tickets and marketplace operations. It supports both primary and secondary markets that allow for ticket creation, purchasing, and bidding, in compliance with ERC721 and ERC20 standards. The system manages ticket metadata, which includes event names, unique IDs, holder details, and validity timestamps. Moreover, it incorporates administrative controls over ticket usage and optimizes transaction processing.

The repository uses [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/projects/working-on-an-existing-project).
